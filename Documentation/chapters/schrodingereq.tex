\chapter{The Schr\"odinger's equation for two particles}

In this chapter, we'd try to formulate the same interaction problems in terms of the Schr\"odinger's equation in the non-moving frame of reference. Consider the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
    \haml(q, q') = -\frac{1}{2m}\pdv[2]{q} -\frac{1}{2m'}\pdv[2]{(q')} + V(q, q')
\end{equation}
The Schr\"odinger's equation then becomes
\begin{equation}
    \im\pdv{t}\eta(q, q'; t) = -\frac{1}{2m}\pdv[2]{\eta(q, q'; t)}{q} -\frac{1}{2m'}\pdv[2]{\eta(q, q'; t)}{(q')} + V(q, q')
\end{equation}
